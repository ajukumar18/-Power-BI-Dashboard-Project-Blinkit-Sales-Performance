🏬 Outlet Analysis – performance by tier, size, and location

📈 Trend Analysis – sales growth patterns from 2012 to 2022

🛒 Item Insights – top-performing categories like fruits, snacks, and household products

⭐ Customer Experience – average ratings across outlets

✨ Skills Applied in this Project:

Data cleaning and modeling using Power Query & DAX

Creating relationships between multiple tables for seamless reporting

Designing interactive visuals with slicers, filters, and KPIs

Applying data storytelling techniques to highlight trends and comparisons

Building a clean and intuitive dashboard layout for professional reporting

💡 Why this project matters:
This dashboard demonstrates how effective data visualization can simplify complex business data, uncover trends, and support decision-making. It reflects my ability to not just analyze numbers, but also communicate insights clearly and visually – a skill every data-driven organization values.
